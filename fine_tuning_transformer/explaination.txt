What fine-tuning changes?
Fine-tuning changes the pretrained model by slightly adjusting its existing weights and fully training a new task-specific head, so the model can learn patterns relevant to the specific task.

Why learning rate is small?
The learning rate is kept small so that the model learns gradually, updating its weights slowly without forgetting the knowledge it already gained during pretraining.

Signs of overfitting in transformer training
1.If training accuracy is more than validation accuracy, then there is a sign of overfitting
2.If training loss decreases gradually but validation loss either gets struck or increases then its a sign of overfitting
